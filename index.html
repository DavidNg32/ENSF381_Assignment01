        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss. 
            Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know what is gonna come through that door.</p>

        <h2>Customer Reviews</h2>
        <p>&starf;&star;&star;&star;&star;<br>"My father smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 
            "If you ever want to see your children graduate, you have to stop immediately.". Tears welled up in his eyes when he realised exactly what was at stake. He gave it up immediately. 
            Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- "Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your father put us through.". 
            I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it because this website gave me cancer anyway." <br><em> - Man.</em></p>
